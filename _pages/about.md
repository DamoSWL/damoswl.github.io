I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Data Science at the University of Virginia, advised by [Prof. Sheng Li](https://sheng-li.org/). Before joining UVA, I completed my master’s studies at the University of Georgia and at the National University of Singapore. I received my bachelor’s degree from Northeastern University in China, and prior to pursuing graduate studies in the United States, I worked as a C/C++ engineer in Chengdu.

My research primarily focuses on 
- *Large Language Models for Reasoning*
- *Graph Representation Learning*
- *Trustworthy Machine Learning*
- *AI for good*
